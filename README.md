- The physics of the rope is organized according to the following principle:
1. When the rope collides with an obstacle, a new point is created - a "touch", which becomes the new last point of the rope. 
2. When pulling the rope back, the "touch" is removed, and the rope removes this point.
3. If this obstacle is a blade, then the rope is cut off.
- There is a background in the form of a board, obstacles (snags) in the form of office buttons, blades in the form of "enemies", the trajectory of the camera.
